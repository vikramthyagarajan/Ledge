Ledge
=====

For mobile development

=====
Ledge helps keep a steady codebase on different platforms. This way, architecture can be reused between Android, iOS etc without keeping separate code bases for each platform. Changes in architecture in one impacts the other. This way, only the views need to be implemented in each language, the rest is reused.
